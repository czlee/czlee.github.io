Hi! There's not much to see here, yet.

For information about my teaching and research while at Stanford University, please see [this page](https://czlee.nz/stanford/).

## Debating software projects

In my spare time, I've written software for competitive debating tournaments.
- [Tabbycat](https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat), a draw tabulation system for debate tournaments.
- [Adjumo](https://github.com/czlee/adjumo), a system that uses optimization to help allocate adjudicators at large debate tournaments. (I describe the system in [this document](adjumo.pdf).)
- [Debatekeeper](https://github.com/czlee/debatekeeper), a timer for debate speeches for Android phones.
