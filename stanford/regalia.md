# Stanford PhD academic regalia

When I was looking at purchasing PhD academic regalia, I found it a little hard to understand the differences between the official provider (Herff Jones) and unofficial providers (Capgown). Now that I've been through it, I wanted to put some anecdotal information somewhere, in the hope that it may help future Stanford PhD graduates.

Basically, the question I was trying to resolve was: Why is Herff Jones (\~$883 in 2022) around twice the price of [Capgown](https://capgown.com/) (\~$465)? I understand that official providers are often more expensive, but a factor of two is a lot.

One obvious difference: Herff Jones makes custom-fitted regalia, whereas Capgown just does standard sizes. But it's a loose hanging gown; how "custom-fitted" does it need to be?

## Direct comparison

Anyway, the main thing that's hard to figure out from online info is a side-by-side comparison.

When lining up for the processions for both commencement and my department's diploma ceremony, I happened to be standing next to someone (different people) who had purchased their regalia from Herff Jones.

I don't really think you can tell the two apart from a distance. But up close there are a few differences.

- **Color (for engineering, orange):** This is actually kind of interesting. The graduate I was standing next to at commencement and I were discussing this, and we both felt that the Herff Jones _hood_ was the "truer" orange, but the Capgown _sleeves_ were the "truer" orange.

  The Herff Jones sleeves were a bit light, so light that he thought they accidentally gave him the science one (golden yellow). But after looking around we didn't think this was the case—other engineering graduates with Herff Jones regalia had a similar color, and I still thought the sleeves were more orange than yellow, so it just seems that the sleeves are lighter.

  On the other hand, the Capgown hood orange was also a bit light. I don't think it was light enough to be confusing, but it was noticeably lighter than the Capgown sleeves and Herff Jones hood.

  So, if you're optimizing for color, I guess you get a Herff Jones hood but a Capgown gown?

- **Material:** The Capgown material is a bit rougher/more matte than the Herff Jones material, which is more cleanly woven. There's nothing wrong with the Capgown material, its quality is perfectly good, but up close I think the Herff Jones material does look more "refined". Knowing now how the materials compare, I would have favored Herff Jones, but not to the tune of a $400 premium.

  (I didn't think to take a comparison photo at the time, sorry.)

- **Crests:** Basically the same. The design itself was broadly indistingushable. I think the Capgown one was more embossed, perhaps suggesting that it was more of a patch-on and less "integrated", but I mean, no one's going to notice that.

- **Latches:** My Capgown hood-to-gown latch cord was on the gown, with a button on the hood. I had to tie an extra knot into this to shorten it, but this might just depend on body proportions. There is also a cord sewn into one side of the gown to latch onto a button on the other side.

  The Herff Jones hood-to-gown cord was on the hood, with a button in the gown. My feeling is that it doesn't really matter which way round this is. But apparently the Herff Jones gown has buttons on both sides with a separate cord to attach them together, which seemed easy to lose.

- **Chevrons/arm bands:** The doctoral chevrons (the three stripes on the upper arm on most American doctoral regalia) are an option on Herff Jones (if you pay a little extra), and not an option on Capgown. Personally I wouldn't have gotten them, since Stanford's doctoral regalia follows the British design more than the American one (see the article on pages 3–9 of [this article in _Sandstone and Tile_](https://purl.stanford.edu/cc344bz5254)) so I think they look out of place, but you might reasonably differ.

For me personally, now that I've seen both regalia up close, I probably would've paid $100 more for Herff Jones, maybe $200 at a stretch, but certainly not $400. The main point in favor of Herff Jones is the material, which isn't really noticeable unless you look closely or touch it.

## How did I know about Capgown?

In 2018, staff in my department used to pass on a marketing email from Capgown as an option. In 2019, this stopped. I never figured out why, but I can only assume there was some administrative directive from the university to stop circulating unofficial options.

I started my PhD in 2015, so had been around long enough to have this email in my archives. Also, a friend of mine who graduated in 2018 did some research into options himself.

There are other unofficial providers, too. My friend ended up going with [Phinished Gown](https://www.phinishedgown.com/) in his year (2018), but in my year (2022) they didn't support Stanford regalia, and I couldn't find any unofficial providers who did other than Capgown.
