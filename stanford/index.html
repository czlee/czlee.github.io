<td align="left"><p>I was a PhD student in electrical engineering at Stanford University from 2015 to 2021. My research
interests were in information theory and federated learning. While I was at Stanford, I also took an
interest in reinforcement learning, wireless communications, computer networks, technology policy,
and engineering education. My advisor was <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~aozgur/">Ayfer Özgür</a>.</p>
<p>I received my BE(Hons) degree in electrical and electronic engineering with first class honors from
The University of Auckland, finishing studies there in 2010, and my MS degree in electrical
engineering from Stanford University in 2015. From 2011 to 2013, I worked as a signal processing
engineer for <a href="http://www.aviatnetworks.com/">Aviat Networks</a> in its Wellington, New Zealand office.
In summer 2019, I worked as a visiting student researcher with Odalric-Ambrym Maillard in the
<a href="https://team.inria.fr/sequel/">SequeL team</a> at Inria Lille-Nord Europe, which later became
<a href="https://team.inria.fr/scool/">Scool</a>.</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I'm passionate about and spent a lot of my graduate school career involved in teaching introductory-level engineering courses.</p>
<h3><sc>engr 40m</sc></h3>
<p>For most of my graduate teaching career, I was involved with <sc>engr 40m</sc>, &ldquo;An Intro to Making: What is <sc>ee</sc>?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Co-instructor, summer 2017 (see our <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/engr/engr40m.1178/slides.html">class notes</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Head <sc>ta</sc>, spring 2016, spring 2017 and spring 2020</p>
</li>
<li><p><sc>ta</sc>, five more times between 2014 and 2018</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For this work, I was humbled to be nominated by my colleagues for and to receive two awards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>James F. Gibbons Outstanding Student Teaching Award, 2016</p>
</li>
<li><p>Centennial Teaching Assistant Award, 2017</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><sc>engr 76</sc></h3>
<p>In spring 2021, I was a <sc>ta</sc> in <a href="https://engr76.stanford.edu/"><sc>engr 76</sc>, &ldquo;Information Science and Engineering&rdquo;</a>, for its inaugural offering, alongside Shubham Chandak. My main contribution here was writing the project handouts that constitute the bulk of coursework for the course.</p>
