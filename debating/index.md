title: Debating software projects
---

In my spare time, I've written software for competitive debating tournaments.

- **[Tabbycat](https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat)**, a draw tabulation system

  This is the project that took up most of my time in debating software. It grew a lot more than we
  anticipated when Philip and I took over the project from its original developer in 2012.

- **[Adjumo](https://github.com/czlee/adjumo)**, an adjudicator allocation system

  Adjumo uses optimization to help with adjudicator allocation and large debating tournaments.
  We wrote it for Thessaloniki WUDC 2016. It didn't go very well, and I describe the system as well
  as the issues we had with it in [this document](adjumo.pdf).

- **[Debatekeeper](https://github.com/czlee/debatekeeper)**, a Android timer app

  My first debating software project was an Android app to time debates, first released in 2012. I
  released version 1.3 in October 2021, and other than maintaining the [debate format
  repository](https://github.com/czlee/debatekeeper-formats), I intend for that to be my last major
  work on it. There is a standing open invitation for anyone to pick up and continue the project.
